Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in python.
Numpy is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects

Numpy array?
is a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to interpret an element.

Advantage of  NumPy array over python list.
> consume less memory.
> fast as compared to the python list.
> convenient to use.

list = [1,2,3,4]
array = [1234]

why NumPy?

wide variety  of mathematical of Numpy
useful for ml and data science

NumPy array vs python list 
 1. Data type storage 
    It can have  multiple data types in a single list.
 2. Importing module
        no any module is needed for list
 3. Numerical operation
         fast in Numpy array( can be implement as matrix )
 4. Modification capabilities
         Modification is fast in list

 5. Numpy use less memory
 6. Numpy array is convenient to use        
      

NumPys primary object is the `numpy.ndarray` commonly referred to as an array.
